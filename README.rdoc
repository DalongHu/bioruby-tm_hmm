A bioruby plugin for running TMHMM automatically on multiple sequences in a FASTA file and manipulation of the results

Note: this software is under active development!

== Installation

        gem install bio-tm_hmm

== Usage

  bio-tm_hmm my.fasta

Where my.fasta is a FASTA file with one or more protein sequences in it. Output will be a description of the transmembrane domains predicted by TMHMM.

Other options include -f for printing out the fasta sequences that have some number of transmembrane domains in them, and ignoring those that done (converse is -g)

  bio-tm_hmm -f 2 <my.fasta

== Developers

To use the library 

        require 'bio-tm_hmm'

The API doc is online. For more code examples see also the test files in
